# The Regional Economic Financial Statistics

_**Provincial Economic and Financial Statistics**_ in Indonesian _**Statistik Ekonomi Keuangan Daerah (SEKDA)**_ are monthly statistics published by **[Bank Indonesia](https://www.bi.go.id)** containing economic, financial and banking data at the provincial level throughout Indonesia.  The data/statistics enable users to observe economic, financial and banking developments in each respective province of Indonesia.â€‹

## Why you need this?

As of now, it's _quite tedious_ to **manually select range for table of a given file (unchanging) and then paste it into word as a picture**, the work itself will take so many effort and time to do, aand in some case you also need to readjust and hide spesific range just to include the heading for specific use.

With this `vba script` you can just do it automatically and also update it using `excel dashboard` that being provided as it is.

### How this came to be a thing?

As part of my curriculum, **I need to do internship** and I was given the opportunity to take part on **[Maluku Province Bank Indonesia Representative Office](https://www.google.com/maps/place/BANK+INDONESIA/@-3.694582,128.1840382,18.71z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x2d6ce851fb4ee61b:0xe1acf525102b41b6!8m2!3d-3.6947983!4d128.1843218)** for 5 months, with the first 2 weeks I was given a task to help increase the productivity and digitalization of _Fungsi Data dan Statistik Ekonomi dan Keuangan (FD-SEK)_ especially the part when they need to make a report in the form of a Book, which is named _**Provincial Economic and Financial Statistics**_ or in Indonesian _**Statistik Ekonomi Keuangan Daerah (SEKDA)**_.
